# J-Term Sprint

	
#### Starting out we need to:
* Get ZenHub set up / add milestones + tasks
* Talk about GitFlow - not working directly in MASTER :) 
	* Instead feature branching - using this format: **feature/name-of-feature**
* Go over features / rank priority 
* Plan out (maybe a week?) ahead and talk about who is doing what 



### Changes / Additional Features
